# OpenBrowser

OpenBrowser is an open-source, AI-native browser built on Chromium — a truly privacy-first alternative to ChatGPT Atlas, Perplexity Comet, and Dia. Instead of sending your data away, OpenBrowser brings powerful AI directly into your browser, so you stay in control.

## Key Features

- **Native AI Agents**: Run AI agents directly in your browser without external services
- **Privacy First**: Use your own API keys or run local models - your data never leaves your computer
- **Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven development
- **Chromium-Based**: Built on the trusted Chromium foundation for compatibility and performance
